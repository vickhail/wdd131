            <h2>2 Nephi 32:3</h2>
            <p>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said
                unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what
                ye should do.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of
                God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his
                shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have
                no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which
                ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

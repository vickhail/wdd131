            <div class="about-content">
                <p>My name is MariajosÃ© Escobar though I prefer to go by Cote with family and friends. I was born in
                    Chile and with my family, we have lived in Argentina and Uruguay, we have returned to Chile
                    recently. I am currently studying with Pathway and hope to continue my learning path with success.
                    As a family, we have a cat named Chanchi and we love her a lot, we enjoy walking and hiking, and we
                    also enjoy watching movies and series about zombies and in general movies and series. Another thing
                    I love to do is read books, paint with watercolors, and play video games with my sister.</p>

                <p>Chile is a long, narrow country stretching along the western edge of South America, with 6,435 km
                    (4,000 miles) of coastline along the Pacific Ocean. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the
                    northeast, Argentina to the east and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chile's landscape features
                    a diverse landscape, including the Atacama Desert in the north, one of the driest places on Earth,
                    fertile valleys and vineyards in the central region, and the rugged Andes mountains that run the
                    country's length. The southern part of Chile is known for its fjords, glaciers, and forests.</p>

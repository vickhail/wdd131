            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Mariajosé Escobar though I prefer to go by Cote with family and friends. I was born in Chile
                and with my family, we have lived in Argentina and Uruguay, we have returned to Chile recently. I am
                currently studying with Pathway and hope to continue my learning path with success. As a family, we have
                a cat named Chanchi and we love her a lot, we enjoy walking and hiking, and we also enjoy watching
                movies and series about zombies and in general movies and series. Another thing I love to do is read
                books, paint with watercolors, and play video games with my sister. </p>

            <h2> Chile </h2>
            <p>Chile is a long, narrow country stretching along the western edge of South America, with 6,435 km (4,000
                miles) of coastline along the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by Peru to the north, Bolivia to the
                northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chile's landscape features a
                diverse landscape, including the Atacama Desert in the north, which is one of the driest places on
                Earth, fertile valleys and vineyards in the central region, and the rugged Andes mountains that run the
                length of the country. The southern part of Chile is known for its fjords, glaciers, and forests.</p>

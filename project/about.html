                    <h2>About the Blogger</h2>
                    <p>Hello there! My name is MariajosÃ© Escobar, a 22-year-old book lover and aspiring software developer. Ever since I was a child, I've been enchanted by the magic of books. From fairy tales that whisked me away to far-off lands, to novels that offered deep insights into the human condition, reading has always been my escape and my education. For my Dynamic Web Fundamentals course I was tasked with creating a site so I decided to create this book blog.<br>
                        <br>Warm regards,<br>MJ E.</p>

                    <h2>How Rankings Are Done</h2>
                    <p>When ranking books I use the follow a little system<br>
                        <br>
                        One-star reviews: These are for books I couldn't get through. They failed to capture my interest or had elements that made it difficult for me to continue reading.<br>
                        Two-stars: These books I made it through but wasn't a fan. They were readable, but I probably won't seek out other works by the same author.<br>
                        Three-stars: These were good and enjoyable, but not great or memorable. They are solid reads that I would recommend to others looking for something pleasant and engaging, but they didn't leave a lasting impact on me.<br>
                        Four-stars: These books were great reads that I thoroughly enjoyed. They kept me engaged from start to finish and are ones I would eagerly recommend to fellow readers.<br>
                        Five-stars: These books made me feel or react with emotion, and I remember everything about them. They are memorable, with elements that stay with me long after I've finished reading, and I would definitely recommend them to others.<br>
                        <br>
                        In this blog, you can also rate the books that you have read, you may use this system or any other you have.
